# Databox
This Java class(Databox.java) allows users to store data in their local system.
It makes use of Java's file management to store and retrieve data.
It is recommended to use it for small-scale projects only, it may not be very efficient on large scales.

The DataCalculation.java class provides users with some simple methods that can be used with Databox objects to perform simple operations on them.

Note: Be careful of the location of these files, in the case of a project keep the 'Databox' folder inside 'src'.

By default, the Databox.java class has been set to store the data in 
Databox > Storage 
This location can be changed when creating the Databox object.
